## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a local copy of the project up and running for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

-   Node.js (v18.0 or later)
-   [Bun](https://bun.sh/) package manager
-   [Wrangler CLI](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/install-and-update/)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/morfit-studio-suite.git
    cd morfit-studio-suite
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    bun install
    ```

### Running Locally

To run the application locally, you'll need to start both the Vite development server for the frontend and the Wrangler development server for the backend worker.

1.  **Start the local development server:**
    This command will start the Vite frontend and the Wrangler backend concurrently.
    ```bash
    wrangler dev
    ```
    The application will be available at `http://localhost:8788`.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into three main directories:

-   `src/`: Contains the frontend React application, including pages, components, hooks, and utility functions.
-   `worker/`: Contains the Cloudflare Worker backend code, including the Hono application, API routes, and Durable Object entity definitions.
-   `shared/`: Contains TypeScript types and mock data shared between the frontend and backend to ensure type safety.

## Development

### Adding API Endpoints

New API routes should be added in the `worker/user-routes.ts` file. Follow the existing patterns using Hono and the provided response helpers from `worker/core-utils.ts`.

### Creating Durable Object Entities

New data models should be defined as classes extending `IndexedEntity` in `worker/entities.ts`. This pattern provides a structured way to interact with Cloudflare Durable Objects for stateful storage.

### Shared Types

To maintain type safety between the client and server, define all shared data structures in `shared/types.ts`.

## Deployment

This project is configured for seamless deployment to Cloudflare.

1.  **Build the application:**
    ```bash
    bun run build
    ```

2.  **Deploy to Cloudflare:**
    Make sure you are logged in to your Cloudflare account via the Wrangler CLI (`wrangler login`).
    ```bash
    bun run deploy
    ```
    This command will build the Vite application and deploy it along with the worker to your Cloudflare account.

Alternatively, you can deploy directly from your GitHub repository.
